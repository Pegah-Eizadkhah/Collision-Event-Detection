# Collision-event-detection-
Game Programming Collision Detection in C#

/*
Pegah Eizadkhah

This C# script is part of a larger set of scripts for a Gaming project.

In this game the player catches & guides a fish (attached to a hook) across a "highway" trying not to collide 
with the enemies (Penguines, other fishes) as the fish is "reeled" back up to the top, 
using the arrow keys for control. The enemies move horizontally, similar to how cars move 
on the highway and the fish moves vertically, and must move across two layers of
highway to get to its home on the other side. There are some enemies that spawn 
randomly in the fish's path. The challenge of this arcarde-style 
game is to not let the fish collide with enemies using good timing and reaction time.

This specific script controls the collision events in the game,
(i.e what happens when the fish collides with an enemy)
This script uses some functions defined in the Unity game engine.
